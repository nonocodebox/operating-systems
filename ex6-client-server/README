ANSWERS:

1. In order to impelement reliable file transfer protocol over UDP version of the excercise,
   we would make the following changes:
   - We would want to know the right order of the data that we recieve (as server) and in order to
     to that we can add headers to each packets we send (as clients) indicating its place.
   - We would also need to split the file data (or any other large data we send) to a size smaller
     than the packet size and add an header indicating the order of the packets (the data with the
     header together are in packet size).

   When the server recieves the packets, it sorts them in their right order according to the header.
   If it sees that the is a packet missing, it sends a message to the client with a request to send
   the data again.
   Once the server recived all packets it sends an ack to the client, indicating the client should
   stop sending. Otherwise the server requests the missing packet by its id.
   Note that this means that the server also sends data to the clients, and the clients also recieve
   data from the server.


2. Graph results
   -------------
   We can see crystal clear that for large file sizes (>= 100kB) when the server and the client are
   running on the same computer the transfer time is faster. For smaller files there isn't any
   noticable difference.
   Also, when the client sends bigger files the transer time is increased respectively in both cases
   (when the server and the client are running on different computers, and when they are running on
   the same computer).

   Note: we left the time measurement code lines in the implementation with a #define to enable them
   (#define MEASURE_PERFORMANCE) which is currently disabled.
